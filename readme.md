# Hotel Booking Analytics API

## Overview

The **Hotel Booking Analytics API** is a Python-based system designed to process hotel booking data, extract actionable insights, and answer user queries through a RESTful API. Built using FastAPI, this system integrates data analytics, natural language processing (NLP), and retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) to provide detailed insights into hotel bookings, revenue trends, cancellation patterns, and more. The project leverages precomputed analytics, a FAISS index for efficient retrieval, and transformer models for question answering.

This system is ideal for hotel managers, data analysts, or researchers looking to explore hotel booking trends and patterns interactively.

### Key Features
- **REST API**: Query hotel booking data via endpoints like `/ask`, `/analytics`, `/health`, and `/query-history`.
- **Analytics Generation**: Precomputes revenue trends, cancellation rates, geographical distributions, and other metrics.
- **RAG System**: Combines retrieval (FAISS) and generation (transformers) to answer natural language questions.
- **Query History**: Stores questions and answers in an SQLite database for later retrieval (bonus feature).
- **Health Monitoring**: Provides system status checks.
- **Visualizations**: Generates plots for revenue, cancellations, lead times, and more.

## Requirements

- Python 3.8+
- Libraries:
  - `fastapi`
  - `uvicorn`
  - `pydantic`
  - `pandas`
  - `numpy`
  - `faiss-cpu` (or `faiss-gpu` for GPU support)
  - `sentence-transformers`
  - `transformers`
  - `matplotlib`
  - `seaborn`
  - `sqlite3` (built-in)
  - `tqdm`
- Input Data: `hotel_bookings.csv` (raw dataset, not included)

Install dependencies:
```bash
pip install fastapi uvicorn pydantic pandas numpy faiss-cpu sentence-transformers transformers matplotlib seaborn tqdm
```

## Setup Instructions

1. **Prepare the Data**
   - Start with the raw dataset `hotel_bookings.csv`.
   - Run the `data_preprocessing.ipynb` notebook to clean the data and save it as `cleaned_hotel_bookings.csv`. This step fills missing values and formats dates.

2. **Generate Analytics**
   - Run `analytics_generator.py` to compute analytics and visualizations:
     ```bash
     python analytics_generator.py
     ```
   - This generates `precomputed_analytics.json` and saves plots in the `visualizations/` directory.

3. **Set Up the RAG System**
   - Run `rag_setup.py` to create the FAISS index and processed data:
     ```bash
     python rag_setup.py
     ```
   - This generates `hotel_data.pkl` and `hotel_index.faiss`. It also tests the system with sample questions.

4. **Run the API**
   - Start the FastAPI server:
     ```bash
     uvicorn main:app --reload
     ```
   - The API will be available at `http://127.0.0.1:8000`.

## Usage

### API Endpoints

- **POST /ask**
  - **Description**: Ask a question about the hotel booking data.
  - **Request Body**: `{"question": "Your question here"}`
  - **Example**:
    ```bash
    curl -X POST "http://127.0.0.1:8000/ask" -H "Content-Type: application/json" -d '{"question": "Show me total revenue for July 2017"}'
    ```
  - **Response**: `{"question": "Show me total revenue for July 2017", "answer": "Total revenue for July 2017: $1736787.49"}`

- **POST /analytics**
  - **Description**: Retrieve all precomputed analytics.
  - **Example**:
    ```bash
    curl -X POST "http://127.0.0.1:8000/analytics"
    ```
  - **Response**: JSON object with analytics data.

- **GET /health**
  - **Description**: Check the system's health status.
  - **Example**:
    ```bash
    curl "http://127.0.0.1:8000/health"
    ```
  - **Response**: `{"status": "healthy", "components": {...}, "timestamp": "..."}`

- **GET /query-history**
  - **Description**: Retrieve the last N queries (default 10).
  - **Query Parameter**: `limit` (optional)
  - **Example**:
    ```bash
    curl "http://127.0.0.1:8000/query-history?limit=5"
    ```
  - **Response**: `{"history": [{"question": "...", "answer": "...", "timestamp": "..."}, ...]}`

### Supported Questions
- Revenue: "Show me total revenue for [Month] [Year]"
- Cancellations: "Which locations had the highest booking cancellations?" or "What bookings were canceled on [Date]?"
- Pricing: "What is the average price of a hotel booking?"
- General: Falls back to RAG for unhandled questions.

## Example Analytics Output

Based on `precomputed_analytics.json`:
- Total Bookings: 119,390
- Cancellation Rate: 37.04%
- Average ADR: $101.83
- Total Revenue: $25,996,260.41
- Average Lead Time: 104.01 days

See `visualizations/` for graphical representations.

## Development Notes

- **Debugging**: The `answer_question` function includes extensive debug logging (`print` statements).
- **Error Handling**: The system gracefully handles missing data and model failures.
- **Extensibility**: Add new question patterns in `answer_question` by extending the regex and logic blocks.

## Limitations

- Requires precomputed data and RAG setup before running the API.
- Assumes the raw dataset (`hotel_bookings.csv`) follows the expected schema.
- RAG performance depends on the quality of embeddings and context retrieval.

## Future Improvements

- Add real-time analytics updates.
- Support more complex queries (e.g., multi-condition filters).
- Integrate a frontend interface for easier interaction.
- Optimize RAG retrieval with larger k-values or different indexing strategies.
